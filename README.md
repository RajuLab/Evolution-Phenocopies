Codes for https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19720

All the simulation is performed by using Julia (1.12.1)
Environmental dependency are reproducible from Manifest.toml and Project.toml

All the figures are reproduced from figures.ipynb and /another_case/Untitled1.ipynb.
/data contained simulation data.

Codes used for evolutionary sampling (evolution.jl) and random sampling are in  /sampling-code.
For random sampling, we started learning process (learning.jl) and then, we sampled functional individuals (sampling.jl), as in Supplemental Material.
